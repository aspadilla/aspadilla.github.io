title: Bio
---
I am Associate Professor of History and International Relations at the Centro Universitario de la Defensa in Zaragoza, Spain. I have also taught at the Complutense University of Madrid, the European University, the University of Navarra, Syracuse University, ESIC Business & Marketing School, Saint Louis University and was a visiting scholar at Georgetown University (2011-12) and the University of Wisconsin-Madison (2016).

I specialize in the history of U.S. foreign policy in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, receiving my Ph.D. from the Complutense University of Madrid in 2014. My dissertation was the basis for my first book, which reinterprets U.S.-Spanish relations in the late nineteenth century under a political economy lens. My papers have appeared in several top peer-reviewed journals in Europe and the Americas (The International History Review, American Nineteenth-Century History, Historia Crítica, Historia y Política, etc), while my current research explores how tax havens, special economic zones and U.S. government agencies in Cold War Latin America undermined import-substitution industrialization (ISI) policies and laid the groundwork for the ‘Washington Consensus.’
