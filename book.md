title: Enemigos íntimos. España y los Estados Unidos antes de la Guerra de Cuba (1865-1898) 

Published in spring 2016, this book tries to answer the following question: What role did the Spanish Monarchy play in the evolution of U.S. foreign policy in the age of imperialism?

> The Gilded Age saw the rise of the U.S. administrative state, the triumph of U.S. capitalism and the definitive emergence of U.S. hemispheric imperialism—yet despite its significance, the period is still under the influence of clichés and misinformation. Obviously the Cuban question figured prominently in U.S.-Spanish relations, but more often than not that issue has overshadowed other concerns, such as the integration of the Spanish Empire within the U.S. capitalist model and the imperialist escalation over the Western Hemisphere. Drawing from extensive archival research in both countries, the book provides a radically new interpretation of U.S.-Spanish relations at a crucial time in the history of both countries.
